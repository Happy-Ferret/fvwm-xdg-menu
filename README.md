fvwm-xdg-menu
=============

This is an xdg-menu for use with fvwm and fvwm-menu-desktop.

The goal is to have an application menu in fvwm that support
out-of-the-box the additional FreeDesktop categories, and that
on any GBU/Linux distrinution.

For now, the files will be provided without any installation
procedure. To copy them in the correct XDG locations must be
enough to make the menu to work fine.

When done, a patch for inclusion into fvwm will be done.
