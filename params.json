{"name":"Fvwm-xdg-menu","tagline":"xdg application menu with full support for the additional categories for fvwm and other xdg compliant desktops","body":"### Welcome to Fvwm-xdg-menu\r\nFvwm-Xdg-menu is a xdg application menu with full support for the additional categories. It is designed with fvwm in mind but should work with any xdg compliant desktop.\r\n\r\nWell almost, it doesn't work with kde. Please don't fill a bug report here, but complain to the kde team instead. Their menu implementation doesn't support fully the additional categories, is not compatible with a compliant menu like this one, and that's definitely not my problem.\r\n\r\n### Download the last release\r\nTo come soon\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDominique Michel (@domichel) started this project in 2014, he has been the main contributor until now.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with fvwm-xdg-menu?
